                <p>
                    I am a student at Bellevue College studying Information Systems-Software Development.
                    I have lived in Washington state my whole life and plan to continue living here for the
                    foreseeable future. I am still very new to learning about software development, but plan
                    to continue learning as much as I can, probably for my whole life. There are many paths
                    to branch off into in the technical field, and I am still exploring the options.
