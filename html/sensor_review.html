    13 kinds of sensors in mobile phones and what are recorded by the sensors</a><br>
    <br>In this article, the author gives an explanation of what sensors in phones are.
        As a person who is learning about sensors, this body of information is a great place to start.
        Readers of this article learn that sensors are small chips and the phone's program software
        uses the data from the chips to calculate all sorts of information, such as brightness, temperature,
        distance, etc. Many functions on the phone and applications use the data from sensors.<br>
        Examples of types of phone sensors are listed and briefly described: Accelerometer, G-sensor, ambient light, proximity, magnetism,
        gyroscope, GPS position, fingerprint, hall, barometer, heart rate, blood oxygen, UV, and temperature.<br>
        <br><strong>Accelerometer:</strong> Measures the speed and direction (x,y,z) of the device. It can be used to calculate your number of steps, is employed in various applications,
        and is used in mobile games.<br>
        <br><strong>G-Sensor:</strong> This is the gravity sensor. The gravity sensor was created using the piezoelectric effect. According to the dictionary, piezoelectric
        is related to the electric polarization resulting from mechanical stress. So the piezoelectric sheet in the gravity sensor creates an electrical charge when mechanically
        stressed. Uses for this sensor include switching between horizontal/vertical screen orientation, and in some balance/racing games for controls.<br>
        <br><strong>Ambient Light:</strong> According to the article, "The light sensor allows the phone to detect the intensity of ambient light and alter the screen brightness accordingly".
        This sensor is helpful for auto-adjusting your device's screen brightness.<br>
        <br><strong>Proximity sensor:</strong> This sensor uses an infrared LED light and an infrared radiation detector. It is commonly used in conjunction with the distance sensor. The proximity
        sensor is used to turn off the phone's screen when the phone is close to a person's ear. The system detects that a person is on a phone call and turns off the screen so that
        they do not accidentally press buttons on the screen.<br>
        <br><strong>Magnetism:</strong> This sensor measures the strength and direction of a magnetic field with magnetoresistance. The magnetic field sensor can determine the phone's x,y,z directions.
        This sensor is useful in navigation applications.<br>
        <br><strong>Gyroscope:</strong> The gyroscope measures the angular velocity of movement along the three-axis. This sensor can be used in conjunction with the accelerometer to provide more precise
        positional information. This sensor can be used in navigation applications and mobile games.<br>
        GPS position: The GPS sensor uses satelite information to calculate the distance between the mobile device and the satelite based on timestamps. GPS is useful for navigation,
        location features, speed measurement, and distance measurement. It is also be used in features such as finding your device if it is lost.<br>
        <br><strong>Fingerprint:</strong> This sensor uses the microcurrent generated between the person's finger's electric field, and the capacitance sensor. This fingerprint sensor is extremely prevalent today.
        It is used to scan a person's fingerprint for security purposes. You can unlock your phone, log in to accounts, pay, and so on.<br>
        <br><strong>Hall:</strong> This sensor uses the Hall magnetoelectric effect. The conductor uses electromagnetic currents to generate a force. The purpose of this sensor is mainly for users with smart leather
        phone cases.<br>
        <br><strong>Barometer:</strong> The barometer measures air pressure using the capacitor's resistance value. An example of an application for this sensor is the health app on iOS.<br>
        <br><strong>Heart rate:</strong> This sensor uses a camera and high-brightness LED light to capture the depth of red light in the user's finger. The system can then determine the number of heartbeats per minute.
        This is used in health related applications and devices.<br>
        <br><strong>Blood oxygen:</strong> This sensor works like the heart rate sensor but is used to determine the oxygen concentration in the user's blood. Applications for this sensor include sports and health.<br>
        <br><strong>UV:</strong> This sensor measures the discharge effect from metals when they release electrons. UV sensors are used for sports and health applications. They are also used to determine the amount of radiation
        in the environment. According to this article, most mobile phones do not use UV sensors.<br>
        <br><strong>Temperature:</strong> This sensor measures the phone's and battery's internal temperatures. If a phone becomes too hot, it will automatically close applications by itself or turn off. The sensor can also
        be used to detect outside air temperatures and human body temperatures.<br>
        <br>This information will be useful to me because it gives me a quick rundown on the functions of many common sensors and briefly explains how they work.

    All the Sensors in Your Smartphone, and How They Work</a><br>
    <br>This article lists and describes the various types of sensors in mobile phones.
        The list includes accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, GPS, biometric, barometer, proximity,
        Soli, LiDAR, and ambient light.<br>
        <br>The <strong>accelerometer</strong> can track your steps, detect your speed, and determine which direction the phone is pointing. According to this article,
        augmented reality apps use this sensor. <br>
        <br> The <strong>gyroscope sensor</strong> detects the phone's orientation. Phones use MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems) gyroscopes.<br>
        <br> The <strong>magnetometer sensor</strong> can detect magnetic metals. You can use your own phone as a metal detector! This sensor is also used with the
        accelerometer and GPS sensors to determine the phone's precise location/direction.<br>
        <br><strong>Biometric sensors</strong> are used for detecting fingerprints and for facial recognition systems. Modern phones place their fingerprint sensors in in-screen circuitry.
        The main types of fingerprint sensors are optical (scanning with light), capacitive (scanning with electronic capacitors), and ultrasonic (scanning with sound waves).
        High-end facial recognition uses an infrared sensor that maps a person's face using dots. A software on the phone interprets these dots to recognize the user's face.<br>
        <br>The <strong>Soli sensor</strong> is basically a radar module. It detects movement near and around the phone.<br>
        <br>The <strong>LiDAR sensor</strong> is a laser light scanning technology that judges the depth of a room. It can probably be useful for augmented reality applications. How exciting!<br>
        <br>This information will be useful to me because it has some interesting facts that I did not know. I can use these fun facts to fuel my creativity and imagination.

    Android Sensor Tutorial</a><br>
    <br>In this article, many types of sensors are categorized into three main sensors; Motion, position, and environment.
         This article tells us the Android sensor API classes and interface. This information is useful to see all the methods and classes
         used to gather sensor information. It also gives readers an example of a sensor that prints three-axis values and a sensor that changes the background color when
         the device is shuffled. 
         <br>This is helpful to me because I can examine how the code is written to utilize sensors. However, it only provides
         two examples. I do like that they write about the methods and their descriptions.

    Android - How to track steps and calculate running distance</a><br>
    <br>In this article, the author explains how he created his mobile app called Gymify.
        The author wanted a simple app that could track his exercises. He explains that using SensorEventListener
        is used within a class to track steps. Snippets of code are provided to show how the classes and methods are used.
        For running on the treadmill, he uses the average step length along with the number of steps taken to give an estimation of distance travelled.
        The step length can be calculated by multiplying your height in centimeters by 0.415 for men and 0.413 for women. The number of steps multiplied by height
        and then divided by 100,000 will give you the distance in kilometers. 
        <br>This is helpful for me because it gives me an insight of how the math is calculated to track your steps and measure distance.

        Augmented reality in mobile phone applications</a><br>
        <br>Factory.hr writes an article for Medium about how augmented reality is used in mobile applications.
            According to their article, the Factory.hr team was working on an app for tourists that enhances user experience of sighseeings.
            They give a brief explanation of what AR is: "augmented reality displays real world objects that are processed and altered by the computer."
            The app to implement augmented reality requires a camera, accelerometer, rotation sensor, and GPS. It also includes a lot of math. The goal is to process 
            data from the real world and data gathered by the sensors for computers to use. They also use 3D projection and azimuth. 3D projection is displaying a 3D object on
            a 2D surface. Azimuth is the angular measurement in a spherical coordinate system that represents the horizontal angle from a cardinal direction. This is way beyond
            my level of expertise, but it is a fascinating topic. All of their work is done to improve user experience by creating cool ways of displaying information.
            <br>This article was helpful to me because I learned that a lot of math is required for working with motion and positional sensors to calculate and return useful data for
            a certain purpose, in their case, finding object location.
